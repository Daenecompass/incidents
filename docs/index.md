# Overview

## Concepts

- Create an **incident** for each investigation
- Each incident has many **tickets**, or pieces of work.
- If a ticket needs to be investigated further, mark it as a **lead**.
- Add **comments**, **attachments**, and **observables** (aka indicators) to a ticket.
- Add **child tickets** to a ticket to break it down into smaller pieces, or to indicate the ticket spawned another piece of work.
