# Incidents

Incidents is a web application for managing non-trivial security incidents

When you first encounter a phishing email, a malware infection, an application
vulnerability, a suspicious login, an act of abuse by an insider, or another
security incident, your security team may create a Slack channel, or a Google
Doc, or a JIRA ticket, to investigate it.

As the investigation's scope increases, though, these tools aren't enough to
manage the incident's complexity.

You might have a dozen people working on 30-40 things at once: collecting
forensic data, conducting forensic analysis, running sweeps, remediating, fixing technology issues, asking your vendors for logs, notifying affected users, communicating with upper management, etc. It's difficult to stay up to date on an incident where all this is being posted in the same chat channel.
